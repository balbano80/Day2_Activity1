    <p>I was born in Oakland, Ca.  I am currently living in San Ramon, Ca.  I am a huge Golden State Warriors fan and while not quite as big, I am also a fan of the San Jose Sharks.
        I am currently enrolled in the UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp program and have to wake up way too early to try and get parking at my closest BART Station.
